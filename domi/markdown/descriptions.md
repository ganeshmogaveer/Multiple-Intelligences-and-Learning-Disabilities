Descriptions:

Linguistic intelligence involves sensitivity to spoken and written language, the ability to
learn languages, and the capacity to use language to accomplish certain goals. This
intelligence includes the ability to effectively use language to express oneself rhetorically
or poetically; and language as a means to remember information. Writers, poets, lawyers
and speakers are among those that Howard Gardner sees as having high linguistic
intelligence. 

Potential careers: writer, editor, attorney, politician, public speaker, historian, librarian, journalist, teacher, tour guide, poet, broadcaster, writer, actor, speech pathologist, translator, interpreter.


Logical-mathematical intelligence consists of the capacity to analyze problems
logically, carry out mathematical operations, and investigate issues scientifically. In
Howard Gardner's words, it entails the ability to detect patterns, reason deductively and
think logically. This intelligence is most often associated with scientific and mathematical thinking. 

Potential careers: accountant, computer programmer, engineer, scientist, detective, computer analyst, computer technician, database designer, economist, lawyer, mathematician, network analyst, financial analyst, investment broker, pharmacist, chemist, physician, physicist, researcher, statistician, game developer, math teacher.


Musical intelligence involves skill in the performance, composition, and appreciation of
musical patterns. It encompasses the capacity to recognize and compose musical pitches,
tones, and rhythms. According to Howard Gardner musical intelligence runs in an almost structural parallel to linguistic intelligence. 

Potential careers: musician, composer, director, audiologist, choir director, dancer, music conductor, music critic, music promoter, music publisher, music retailer, music teacher, music therapist, piano tuner, recording engineer, singer, songwriter, sound editor, sound engineer, speech pathologist.


Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence entails the potential of using one's whole body or parts of
the body to solve problems. It is the ability to use mental abilities to coordinate bodily
movements. Howard Gardner sees mental and physical activity as related. 

Potential careers: athlete, physical therapist, occupational therapist, mechanic, chef, dancer, actor, construction worker, choreographer, performer, physical education instructor, craftsperson, surgeon, farmer, carpenter, park warden, firefighter, paramedic, personal trainer, fisherman.


Spatial intelligence involves the potential to recognize and use the patterns of wide
space and more confined areas. 

Potential careers: artist, architect, inventor, bus driver, graphic designer, advertiser, engineer, fashion designer, interior decorator, film animator, photographer, pilot, sailor, cartographer, painter, sculptor, strategic planner, surveyor, truck driver, urban planner.


Interpersonal intelligence is concerned with the capacity to understand the intentions,
motivations and desires of other people. It allows people to work effectively with others.
Educators, salespeople, religious and political leaders and counselors all need a well developed interpersonal intelligence. 

Potential careers: counselor, teacher, politician, manager, diplomat, leader, mediator, human resources executive, social worker, receptionist, sales representative, child care worker, coach.


Intrapersonal intelligence entails the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's
feelings, fears and motivations. In Howard Gardner's view it involves having an effective
working model of ourselves, and to be able to use such information to regulate our lives. 

Potential careers: writer, counselor, psychologist, philosopher, career counselor, consultant, criminologist, program planner, entrepreneur.

What is the Theory of Multiple Intelligences?

The theory of multiple intelligences was developed in 1983 by Howard Gardener. Instead of a single Full Scale IQ score that conventional intelligence tests produce which can have a fairly narrow and specific focus, Gardener proposed that there are seven different areas that a person can be intelligent in and everyone is a different balance of these. He has since added two additional areas, Naturalistic and Existential. All nine of these areas can also interact with each other as well, as learning does not occur in isolation. This quiz will only focus on the original seven areas.


Examples of schools that has incorporated the theory of Multiple Intelligences into their daily curriculum: 
Lincoln Prairie - https://lincolnprairie.sd54.org/resources/multiple-intelligences/
New City School - https://www.newcityschool.org/
Brown Street Academy - http://www5.milwaukee.k12.wi.us/school/brown/



Disclaimer/decsription on results page:

This is an informal survey of multiple intelligences. Since it is not standardized your scores are only in comparison to yourself. It is interpreted by looking at relative highs and lows rather then exact numbers. Everyone is a different balance of these strengths and weakness.   


Immediate results statement (for test page):
