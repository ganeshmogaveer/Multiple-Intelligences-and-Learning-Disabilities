[What will we do when we encounter a conflict?]
    Comunication is key. We are all friendly and know nothing needs to be taken personally. The more we create space for each other to expres ourselves, the more psychologically safe we will be! We will talk through issues with each other, calmly, as they arise. If we are unable to resolve on our own, we will ask Haley, who is acting PM, to intervene. If Haley is unable to find a solution, she will tag in a TA. 

[How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?]
    Responsiblity will be delegated to Haley, as PM, who will keep everyone on task. Group understands that Haley is just doing her job if she raises an issue. We all recognize that we're doing the best we can, and we will not approach these issues from an accusatory place. We will check in with each other, assuming best intent, to make sure team members feel supported if they are falling short.

[What is your process to resolve conflicts?]
    When we feel we need to, we can take a step back, cool down, approach it from a space of remembering we're on the same team and start tackling it fresh. Space and patience are key!

[How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?]
    If team members have an issue, they will raise them to Haley. If she is unable to resolve them with direct communication with the team member, she will discuss how to proceed with Jeff or one of the TA's.
